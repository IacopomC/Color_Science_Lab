# **Color Science Lab in ThreeJS** 

This repository contains the implementation of the final project of the Real Time 3D Visualization course. It's a 3D scene containing a Color Science Lab where the video is displayed on a curved screen alognside an elevation map and a color cloued. Everything was implemented using only primitives from the Javascript 3D Library [Three JS](https://threejs.org/).
